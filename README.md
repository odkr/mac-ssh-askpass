# mac-ssh-askpass

**mac-ssh-askpass** prompts the user for input, typically a passphrase,
with an [Aqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(user_interface)) dialogue,
and prints that input to STDOUT. In short, it conforms to the so-called
[SSH Askpass Protocol](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add). You can use it with
[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) and other tools that understand that
protocol.

**mac-ssh-askpass** is absurdly simple. So simple that I wonder why I couldn't
find anything like it.

## SYNOPSIS

```sh
SSH_ASKPASS=mac-ssh-askpass ssh-add </dev/null
```

This invokes **ssh-add**, instructing it to use **mac-ssh-askpass** to query
you for passphrases. You will typically set an environment variable to
tell a utility to use **mac-ssh-askpass**, rather than invoking it directly.
